# Bot-hoven: A Transformer-Based “Composer” in the Style of Beethoven

![Beethoven Sketch](./images/beethoven.png)

(WIP) Bot-hoven is an end-to-end deep learning architecture that generates solo piano music in the style of Ludwig van Beethoven’s works.

## Data

The data directory includes two datasets: full_beethoven includes only the 32 Piano Sonatas (some full midis and some split into movements) and maestro_beethoven includes Beethoven works from the International Piano E-Competition retrieved from Magenta's full MAESTRO dataset. We use full_beethoven to train our model.
